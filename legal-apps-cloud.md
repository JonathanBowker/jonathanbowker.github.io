## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, in-house legal departments are struggling to keep up with compliance workloads whilst facing pressure to control costs. In response to this, forward thinking business leaders are seeking to implement and deploy technology enabled privacy solutions to help in-house legal professionals work more effectively and create more value whilst improving experiences for all stakeholders in the supply chain, and reduce the spend on outside legal counsel.

To help business leaders transform in-house legal departments into modern data protection and privacy law practices, Advanced Analytica offers a **Digital Solutions Programme**. The core value of this programme is to enable in-house legal teams to engage with agile methodlogy and no-code technology to turn spreadsheets, workflows and knowledge into standalone applications without engaging IT teams or external developers. 

No-code applications can be designed, built and deployed in a matter of weeks, meaning legal teams and business leaders see the benefits of using technology faster without long term investment. The programme assists with   building and deploying digital solutions and making more effective use of legal and IT resources whilst ensuring the delivery of high-value legal services aligned with business objectives and client needs.

## Programme - Digital Solutions Programme
Advanced Analytica's Digital Solutions Programme enables General Counsel to work with senior legal technologists, accredited by the Law Society of Scotland, to build and operate expert legal systems and self-help solutions. The programme starts by identifying bottlenecks in existing processes with a focus on data, workflow and front-end interfaces. We then recommend suitable database architecture, connection and configuration systems, and support the build and operation of no-code applications.

### The programme focusses on 3 core competencies for delivering no-code applications:

- **Data storage**: We use tools like Airtable and SmartSuite to store your data. They might look like spreadsheets, but they are powerful, browser-based databases!
  
- **Workflow automation**: Make.com and Zapier platforms can automate repetitive tasks within your workflows and be integrated with your legal applications.
  
- **Front-end interfaces**: Give your stakeholders and application subscribers a user-friendly interface that has role based permissions for creating, reading, updating and deleting data.
